## [VTOLVR Reference Card Release V3.0](https://github.com/TheChemistAstronaut/VTOLVR-QUICK-REFERENCE-CARDS/releases/tag/V3.0)


With the incoming release of communications frequencies and weather to VTOLVR, I have went ahead and updated the reference cards to reflect the new additions, alongside adding an entirely new one. All of the released reference cards now conform to the 2:3 standard ratio to allow for the [OpenKneeboard](https://github.com/OpenKneeboard/OpenKneeboard) GUI to remain stationary for ergonomics if using a drawing tablet.

### Updated Briefing Card

The briefing card has been updated with new weather and frequency slots. The frequency area has been left as a multi-line textbox to allow for flexibility in how frequencies are used between flights, and the weather allows for multiple locations and times to be entered into the forecast.

### Flight Leading Reference Cards

Split into two parts - general flight leading for all flights, and role-specific (ie. EW, DEAD, CAP) Flight Leading considerations. Given the plethora of flight leadership styles and techniques in the community, I have kept the checklists and references very general to allow for differences in personal taste while still outlining basic best practices.

### RWR Alphabetical Reference Card

The all-new RWR reference card lists all of the possible RWR symbols in alphabetical order, in a color-coded (BLUFOR/REDFOR) format with threat levels and ranges. This allows for the quick transition from an RWR reading to identifying the threat in case you have forgotten what any of the specific symbology means. Key included.

### Unified Carrier Recovery Reference Card

With the introduction of CASE III operations and frequencies into CAW8 operations, I have updated my previous card with the CASE III procedure and slots for frequencies and other figures relevant for carrier recovery - such as your assigned altitude, DME, and final bearing.

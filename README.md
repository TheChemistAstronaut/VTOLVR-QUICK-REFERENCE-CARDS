# VTOLVR-QUICK-REFERENCE-CARDS
This is a collection of quick reference cards concerning in-game weapon and aircraft systems for usage with an in-game kneeboard (Such as OpenKneeBoard) within VTOL VR.

Moving forwards, in order to conserve aspect ratio between OpenKneeBoard tab changes, all cards will be reformatted to **9x16 vertical format** (This is your standard HD 1920x1080 aspect ratio).

The Folder "Reference Cards" contains the cards themselves, ready for import into OpenKneeboard

Source Files contains the .PSD photoshop files for each card in case any changes need to be made. Some cards are WIP.
